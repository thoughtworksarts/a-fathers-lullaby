    description="At 2018 HUBweek, We The Future conference, we prototyped an immersive participatory installation inside a shipping container; a self-contained model of a complex interactive media installation that could be accessible at any public site as a low budget traveling exhibit, alternative to a gallery or museum space. Collaborators: Hisham Bedri (pressure sensor panels with audio playback and light activation), Christian Gentry (live sound composition), Halsey Burgen (geolocated participatory website), Farid Manshadi & Jason Bashaw & Omid Fallahazad & Nedallah Fahandej & Kevin Long (installation), Afshin Fahandezh & Lizandro Segura (documentation)"

    description="The first chapter of the project was launched in 2017, when artist served as Boston Artist-in-Residence with mayorâ€™s Office of Art and Culture and Boston Centers for Youth & Families, in collaboration with Blackstone Community Center in South End and in connection with my role as Research Fellow at MIT Open Documentary Lab.
The culmination of these experiences was shared with the public in a participatory media installation at Villa Victoria Center for the Arts, 2017, at the heart of the community where the work was produced."
